# Cuis7-4
Cuis Smalltalk version 7.4 Stable Release

## About Cuis

Cuis is an Open Source, multiplatform [Smalltalk-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) system.

What sets Cuis apart from other Smalltalk systems is the focus on the original values of the Smalltalk project at Xerox PARC, and an active attitude towards system complexity: Keep it to a minimum!

There is more to be said about Cuis. Please see the
[Documentation](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis7-4/blob/master/Documentation/).

## Running Cuis

The easiest way to download and run Cuis is to download the [Zip file](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis7-4/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Double click on it to unzip. Or you can just clone this Git repo instead.

Run the appropriate start script (RunCuisOnWindows.bat, RunCuisOnLinux.sh, CuisVM.app). To start Cuis on a Mac from Terminal, run RunCuisOnMacTerminal.sh.

Note: On Mac, if you dowloaded the Zip File, you'll likely need to open a Terminal on the Cuis folder, and run ./unquarantine.sh . This is needed for macOS to allow running an application extracted from a Zip file.
